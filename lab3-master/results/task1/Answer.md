# Task 1: Ansewers
## Questions

1. Within the **"Survey & Roofline"** view, references are made to both **Total time** and **Self-time**. What is the difference between these two terms?

- **Total time**: The total time it takes for a function to execute, including the time spent in any other functions (child functions).
- **Self-time**: The time the function spends executing on its own, excluding any time taken by its child functions.

3. Click on the **"roofline"** within the "Survey & Roofline" and observe that no chart appears. What could be the reason for this absence?

- The chart doesnt appears because we need to check "trip count" and "FLOP" boxes in order to obtain the graph.

4. Perform an analysis focusing on trip-counts and FLOP (Floating Point Operations). What new information is presented in the survey view? Capture this information and discuss the most pertinent new data.

- If we focus on trip-counts and FLOP we have survey's graph and roofline's graph, also we have average number of trip-counts, GFLOPS, GINTOPS and DRAM bandwith.
