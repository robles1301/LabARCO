# Task 2
Parallelize at least two more operations in addition to the centroid. Once all modifications are made, save the code in results/task2.
Check that the results are still correct. Importantly, try running the program several times, as some errors only occur on certain occasions.

## Does the parallel code improve compared to the sequential code?
**Answer here, show the results and write your conclusions**

As we can see we have improve the time in each stage, the screenshot of the time are in this directory. The code after parallelization is faster because it distributes instructions into CPU's cores.
