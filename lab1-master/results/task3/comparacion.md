# Performance and Memory Comparison

## 1. Execution Time Results
- **g++ Compiler**: 0.070seg.
- **Intel Compiler**: 0.080seg.

## 2. Performance
- **g++ Compiler**:
  - FLOP metrics: 0.771 GFLOPS.
- **Intel Compiler**:
  - FLOP metrics: 0.675 GFLOPS

## 3. Memory Usage
- **g++ Compiler**:
  - Memory used: 3.025 GB.
- **Intel Compiler**:
  - Memory used: 3.025 GB.

## 5. Conclusion
The g++ compiler outperformed the Intel compiler in both execution time (0.070s vs. 0.080s) and FLOP metrics (0.771 GFLOPS vs. 0.675 GFLOPS), with identical memory usage for both. These results suggest g++
provided better performance in this specific case.
